      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Alex! I’m a Chicago burbs native and fertility nurse currently living in downtown Chicago with my high school sweetheart, Harry. We love to travel, and I can’t lie… my favorite part of experiencing a new city is eating my way through it! If you’re like us, you don’t travel to sit in a local McDs or touristy restaurant — you want to experience the best, local, must-try dishes a city has to offer.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t take long to realize that eating out for every meal gets expensive, really fast. Plus, the drool-worthy restaurants you see on your favorite Food Network or Netflix shows usually come with a high price tag. Cue A Budget Abroad, your one stop shop for local, authentic food destinations that deliver amazing food and dining experiences without breaking your budget.</p>
      <p>Another thing I love? A good deal. Harry will attest, I’m always looking for that sale, promo, or app that lets us eat for a fraction of the price… and that’s not easy to find when traveling abroad. Whether you’re traveling as a couple, with friends, or solo-dolo, A Budget Abroad helps you get a taste of the best food a city has to offer without worrying about affording your next hostel.</p>
      <p>We serve it up hot and fast with three review categories:</p>

      <h3>Abroad All-Stars</h3>
      <p>are the spots where we loved what we ate and would recommend again and again. (And again!)</p>
      <h3>Splurge Worthy</h3>
      <p>are spots we’ve found with a slightly higher price tag, but well worth the price. (They’re a splurge, but not break the bank!)</p>
      <h3>Honorable Mentions</h3>
      <p>are additional spots we didn’t get to experience first-hand, but have garnered a reputation for great food at a great price. (Let us know what you think if you get a chance to try!)</p>
